> ***SQM 2022 adheres to the IUPAP policy statements***

**Free Circulation of Scientists**: The principle of the Universality of Science is fundamental to scientific progress. This principle embodies freedom of movement, association, expression and communication for scientists, as well as equitable access to data, information and research materials. In pursuing its objectives with respect to the rights and responsibilities of scientists, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) actively upholds this principle, and, in so doing, opposes any discrimination on the basis of such factors as ethnic origin, religion, citizenship, language, political stance, gender, or age. IUPAP should only sponsor conferences and events at institutions and in countries that uphold this principle. If scientists are excluded from attending IUPAP-sponsored international conferences by a host institution or country on the basis of any of these factors, IUPAP should register its concern at the highest level of that institution or country, and should not sponsor any future events in that country until such exclusions have been eliminated [ [Section 1, IUPAP Conference Policies](https://iupap.org/conferences/conference-policies/){:target="_blank"} ].

**Harrassment at Conferences**: It is the policy of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) that all participants in Union, and Union-endorsed activities will enjoy an environment which encourages the free expression and exchange of scientific ideas, and is free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. The conference organisers will name an advisor who will consult with those who have suffered from harassment and who will suggest ways of redressing their problems, and an advisor who will counsel those accused of harassment. The conference organisers may, after due consideration, take such action they deem appropriate, including warning or expulsion from the conference without refund.
