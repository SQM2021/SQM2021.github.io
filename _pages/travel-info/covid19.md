### Quarantine Exemption Certificate

We are now probing how to apply the exempting quarantine for persons who weren't vaccinated<sub>(for medical reasons, etc.)</sub>. There’s another possible procedure to apply for the exemption, it needs another application procedure of us and participants with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in your country.

We will check the persons who needed this procedure prior to one month of conference, and contact them individually to apply for the exemptions.

{% endcomment %}
### Upgrade Your Participation from Online to Offline
According to the new regulation about quarantine, we expect that more participants would like to attend the conference offline by visiting Korea. Hence, we modify the present registration policies to upgrade the registration type from online to offline.

You can have more information on [*this webpage.*](/pages/general-info/registration/#upgrade){:target="_blank"}

## Rule of Exemption of Mandatory Quarantine for Vaccinated Passengers

Following are the definitions of **“Fully-Vaccinated Person”**.

* ***Between 14 days and 180 days after the last shot*** of the full vaccination in WHO EUL.  
   *(Mix-and-match can be accepted; If req. # of shots for full vaccination > 1)*
