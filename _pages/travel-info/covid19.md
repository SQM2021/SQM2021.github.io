### Upgrade Your Participation from Online to Offline
According to the new regulation about quarantine, we expect that more participants would like to attend the conference offline by visiting Korea. Hence, we modify the present registration policies to change the participation online to offline to encourage the participants to attend the conference in person.

You can have more information in [*this webpage*](/pages/general-info/registration/#upgrade){:target="_blank"}

### If you are not fully-vaccinated…

We are now probing how to apply the exempting quarantine for persons who weren't vaccinated<sub>(for medical reasons, etc.)</sub>. There’s another possible procedure to apply for the exemption, it needs another application procedure of us and participants with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in your country.

We will check the persons who needed this procedure prior to one month of conference, and contact them individually to apply for the exemptions.

## Rule of Exemption of Mandatory Quarantine for Vaccinated Passengers
{:#vaclisting}

**Fully-Vaccinated Persons** can have exemption from mandatory quarantine.  
Following are the definitions of **“Fully-Vaccinated Person”**.

* ***Between 14 days and 180 days after the last shot*** of the full vaccination in WHO EUL.  
   *(Mix-and-match can be accepted; If req. # of shots for full vaccination > 1)*  
   &nbsp; ***OR***
* Received vaccine shots in WHO EUL, with required number of shots for full vaccination.
