The main international airport in Korea is Incheon International Airport (ICN, RKSI). International flights from almost all Europe, America, Africa, and Asia arrive.
Participants from neighboring countries such as China, Japan, and other South East Asia countries can directly travel to Busan via flights to Busan-Gimhae International Airport (PUS, RKPK). 
<!--
Taking pictures or videos is forbidden because the Korean airforce use Busan-Gimhae airprot as military fortification.
