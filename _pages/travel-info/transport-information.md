## Entering Korea
![Airport of Korea](/assets/img/slider/airport.jpg){: width="80%"}

A main airport of Korea is Incheon International Airport(ICN, RKSI). International flights from almost other contries to Korea usually arrive at Incheon airport. You can be also admitted to Korea by using Incheon airport.  
If you live in East Asia or South East Asia, then Busan-Gimhae International Airport(PUS, RKPK) can be available. Busan-Gimhae airport is located in Busan and the nearest airport from Haeundae which is venue of SQM 2022. Using Busan-Gimhae airport is more faster than Incheon airport to arrive at destination. For reference DON'T take pictures or videos in the airport because Gimhae airport is military fortification.

### Using Samsung Pay

{: #samsungpay }

Republic of Korea is home country of *Samsung* and *Samsung Pay*, but, unfortunately, you may not use *Samsung Pay* in Republic of Korea. (And also the *Apple Pay* is not supported.) The mobile phone selling in Republic of Korea is fully supported to use *Samsung Pay* in Republic of Korea. But, the mobile sold in outside of Republic of Korea may not support due to absence of MST<sub>Magnetic Secure Transmission</sub> module in the device. (Because, the Samsung Pay in Korea is based on MST, but the worldwide(rather than Republic of Korea), that is NFC; similar with Visa-Paywave, MasterCard-Paypass etc.)  
Please be careful and do prepare plan to pay with other than *Samsung Pay* and *Apple Pay*.
