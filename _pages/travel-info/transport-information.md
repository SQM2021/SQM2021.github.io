### Using Samsung Pay

Republic of Korea is home country of *Samsung* and *Samsung Pay*, but, unfortunately, you may not use *Samsung Pay* in Republic of Korea. (And also the *Apple Pay* is not supported.) The mobile phone selling in Republic of Korea is fully supported using *Samsung Pay* in Republic of Korea. But, mobile sold in outside of Republic of Korea may not support due to absence of MST<sub>Magnetic Secure Transmission</sub> module in the device. (Because, the Korea Samsung Pay is based on MST, but the worldwide(rather than Republic of Korea), that is NFC; similar with Visa-Paywave, MasterCard-Paypass etc.)  
Please be careful and prepare plan to pay with other than *Samsung Pay* and *Apple Pay*.
