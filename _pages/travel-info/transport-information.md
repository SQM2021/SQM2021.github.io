## To Busan
![Enter to Busan](/assets/img/slider/map.png){: width="90%"}

A main airport of Korea is Incheon International Airport(ICN, RKSI). The international flights from almost all contries (in Europe, America, Africa, Asia) arrive at this airport. You can be also admitted to Korea by using that.
The visitors from neighboring contries with Korea such as China, Japan and other South East Asia contries can use Busan-Gimhae International Airport(PUS, RKPK). It is more faster to use Busan-Gimhae airport than Incheon's one. Taking pictures or videos is forbidden because the Korean airforce use Busan-Gimhae airprot as military fortification.

If you decide to use Incheon Airport, then you can use 3 ways for arriving to Busan.
