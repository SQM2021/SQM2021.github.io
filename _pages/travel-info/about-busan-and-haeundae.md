![Dadaepo](/assets/img/introduction/Dadaepo.jpg){: width="100%"}
    
  Dadaepo Beach, where Nakdonggang River and the South Sea meet, allows you to enjoy the beauty of nature with Busan’s sunrise, sunset, and sandy beach. The smoothness of Dadaepo Beach’s soft white sand is thanks to the long weathering period. The unique texture of the sand brushing between the toes provides a refreshing and pleasant sensation. The shallow and warm beach also makes it the perfect play place for children. The colorful toy forklifts and trucks parked on the white sandy beach create a cute scene. Recently, the beach is packed with people paddleboarding or kiteboarding.

### Morundae (몰운대)

  There is a small hill protruding out towards the sea at the left end of Dadaepo Beach. This is Morundae. This island is often foggy and cloudy due to the sea currents, which make the island nearly invisible. Hence the name Morundae, meaning an island sinking under the cloud.

We’re talking about Taejongdae Park at the southern end of Yeongdo, Busan. Taejongdae was named after King Taejong Muyeol of Silla, who used to stop by the region and practice archery as he was mesmerized by the beauty of the landscape.

Those who wished to bring it back to its former beauty joined forces to repair the abandoned beach, making it even more breathtaking than it was in its heyday. With its spotless sandy beach, clear water, cloud trails, and an overwater cable car, Songdo Beach is once again a popular tourist destination receiving over five million visitors per year.

![Yongdusan park](/assets/img/introduction/Yongdusan.jpg){: width="100%"}
    
  Even though the road to Yongdusan Park has an ascending slope, the trees cast a cool shade along the road, making it a pleasant walk to the entrance of the park. For travelers who will take the Busan Metro, they can use the escalator entrance close to the station to reach the park more conveniently.

  Military camp and park—these two words do not match well together. However, there is a place where a military camp is reborn as a park, namely Busan Citizens Park.

  While the village’s beautiful landscape gave it the nickname of the Machu Picchu of Korea, the town was a part of the painful history of Busan. Refugees settled in Gamcheon Village during the Korean War and cultivated the mountainous region to make a living. In 2009, students, artists, and residents decorated the village as a part of the Village Art Project, and the town grew into a leading tourist attraction of Busan since then.
