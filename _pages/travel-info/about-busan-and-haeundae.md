Busan is the second largest city in Korea. The Korean culture has dominated Busan for thousands of years. The East Sea and the Southern Sea meat at Busan. The properties of the East Sea are deap water level and blue colour and the one of Southern Sea is broad sandy beach, many bluffs, indented coastline and many islands. So, there are various wonderful beaches in Busan. Furthermore, "Bu" in Busan means cauldron and "San" means mountains. The reason why it's named like that is that there are amazingly many and dense mountains. I want to introduce you 4 beaches and 6 mountains.

Chiwon Choe (A.D. 668 ~ ???) who is one of the best philosopher and poets of the United Silla dynasty (A.D. 676 ~ 935) visited this beach and was impressed. So he named this beach as "Haeundae" from his nom de plume "Haeun". When it's the peak season, nowady, there is a legend that 1 million people per day gather in Haeundae because of the beauty of it.
