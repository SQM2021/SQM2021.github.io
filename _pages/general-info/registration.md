Registration will open on **1 December 2021** and will continue through **1 June 2022**: it will be handled by the [CERN Indico system](https://indico.cern.ch). If you don’t have a valid CERN account, you can create a lightweight [here](https://account.cern.ch/account/Externals/RegisterAccount.aspx).

The conference fee is **550000 ₩** for early registration (for participants who register and pay within **1 April 2022**) and **650000 ₩** for late registration (after **1 April 2022**). The fee includes all the coffee breaks and lunches, the welcome and poster session receptions, the excursion, the conference banquet and, if available, a printed copy of the Conference Proceedings. The full fee for **accompanying persons** is **250000 ₩** and includes coffee breaks, lunches and social events. Reduced fee options for accompanying persons joining excursion and/or social dinner only are also available. Note that the **early fee** can be applied only if the payment is received by **1 April 2022**. After this date, the full fee applies, also for registrations made before 1 April. For the participants whose institution requires an invoice before making the payment, the early fee will be kept also after 1 April, if the invoice is requested before 1 April.

Payment will be possible starting from **1 February 2022**. Registration will be considered completed in the Indico list of registrants only after the payment has been made. Once you have registered, your registration will appear in Indico as “**awaiting payment**”. Payments can be made by bank transfer as detailed below. An alternative option for payment via credit card is currently being set up. The status of the registration in INDICO will be changed to “**complete**” by our administrative staff after your payment is received. **Note that it may take about one week for the update of the status**. Regular receipt of payment will be distributed at the registration desk upon arrival in Bari.

The **registration closes on 1 June 2022**. On-site registration and payment will not be possible.
