It is the policy of the *20<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Strangeness in Quark Matter (SQM 2022)* that all participants, including attendees, vendors, SQM 2022 staff, volunteers, and all other stakeholders at SQM 2022 will conduct themselves in a professional manner that is welcoming to all participants and free from any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Participants will treat each other with respect and consideration to create a collegial, inclusive, and professional environment at SQM 2022. Creating a supportive environment to enable scientific discourse at SQM 2022 is the responsibility of all participants.

Participants will avoid any inappropriate actions or statements based on individual characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, nationality, political affiliation, ability status, educational background, or any other characteristic protected by law. Disruptive or harassing behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. Harassment includes but is not limited to inappropriate or intimidating behavior and language, unwelcome jokes or comments, unwanted touching or attention, offensive images, photography without permission, and stalking.

Violations of this code of conduct policy should be reported to meeting organizers or SQM 2022 staff. Sanctions may range from verbal warning to ejection from the meeting without refund, to notifying appropriate authorities. Retaliation for complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated. If a participant observes inappropriate comments or actions and personal intervention seems appropriate and safe, they should be considerate of all parties before intervening.
