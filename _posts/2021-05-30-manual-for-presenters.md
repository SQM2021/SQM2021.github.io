### Speakers

Presentation files, **possibly in PDF format**, must be **uploaded to the Indico site by 16:00 the day before** the talk. They could stay available to the organisers only, till the beginning of the corresponding session. The instructions to upload your talk are the following:

- find your talk on indico and click on it;

- in the resulting white pop-up window, click on the icon in the top right hand corner (‘View contribution details’);
  
- on the resulting page, click on the pen icon on the right alongside ‘Presentation Materials’, which takes you onward to ‘Upload files’.
  
All meeting rooms have their own computers connected to projectors and presentation files will have to be downloaded from Indico on the local disk well in advance before the session starts. We plan to use room computers for all talks to avoid switch-over times, so please do not expect to project from your personal laptop except in an emergency. Rooms are also equipped with a hand-held integrated laser-pointer and page-turner. There will be a scientific secretary from the local organizing team in all of the meeting rooms to help in case of problems.

 

### Poster Presenters

Posters, printed out in A0 vertical format (width = 841mm, height = 1189mm), can be displayed in a dedicated area at the Giulia Conference Center (sala B1 + C1). The area will open for **poster mounting from Monday 10 June after the lunch time (around 14:00)** till Tuesday 11 June at 14:00. Poster boards will be numbered by means of the abstract ID from Indico. Double-sided tape will be provided for the poster stands. Please do not use pins. The posters should be **removed at the end of the session on Tuesday 11** (around 21:00).

The PDF files of the posters should also be uploaded to the Indico server, for browsing during the conference and for future reference.
