The International Conference on Strangeness in Quark Matter (SQM 2022) will focus on new experimental and theoretical developments on the role of strange and heavy-flavour quarks in high energy heavy ion collisions and in astrophysical phenomena.

SQM 2022 will be the 20th edition of the conference series following the recent events in New York (2021), Bari (2019) and Utrecht (2017). The full history of the SQM conferences is listed here.

The scientific issues:

* Strangeness and heavy-quark production in nuclear collisions and hadronic interactions.
* Hadron resonances in the sQGP(strongly-interecting Quark-Gluon Plasma)
* Bulk matter phenomena associated with strange and other heavy quarks.
* Strangeness in astrophysics
* QCD phase structure
* Collectivity in small systems
* The quadraquarks and pentaquarks.
* Open questions and new developments
