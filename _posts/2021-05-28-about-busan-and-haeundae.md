    The Mt. Geumjeong is located in Busan. “Geum” is gold and “Jeong” is well in Korean. At the summit of the mountain, there is the Ssib rock which is filled with water. “Ssib” is slang of vagina. The water is gold-coloured, thus this is origin of Geumjeong. According to a folktale, the golden fish descended from the sky and raped the Ssib rock. “Beom” is raping and “eo” is fish in Korean. It is origin of this temple.
