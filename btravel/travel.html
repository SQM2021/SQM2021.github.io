      <p>
        Busan is the second largest city in Korea. The Korean culture has dominated Busan for thousands of years. Furthermore, it was the capital city during Korean War, so many refugees gathered to avoid war. It would be a chance to crossover a lot of culture, so it births lots of landmarks in Busan.

      <h2>Haeundae</h2> 
      <p>
        The Haeundae Beach was named by Chiwon Choe. When he rusticated and traveled to visit a Temple, he reached the Haeundae by accident. He was fascinated the landscape of the see, so he engraved his nom de plume, Haeun, to Dongbeak island, which is located in the Haeundae. Nowaday, this beach become a favourite bathing resort in the Korea.

      <h2>Beomeosa</h2>
      <p>
        The Mt. Geumjeong is located in Busan. “Geum” is gold and “Jeong” is well in Korean. At the summit of the mountain, there is the Ssib rock which is filled with water. “Ssib” is slang of vagina. The water is gold-coloured, thus this is origin of Geumjeong. According to a folktale, the golden fish descended from the sky and raped the Ssib rock. “Beom” is raping and “eo” is fish in Korean. It is origin of this temple.
